RC PICKUP TRUCK PROJECT: HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW

# PROJECT CONCEPT
Creating a remote-controlled electric pickup truck with industrial automation components 
to demonstrate both mechanical design skills and industrial control capabilities. This serves 
as both a functional RC vehicle and a portfolio piece for 
automation/robotics positions.

# KEY COMPONENTS
Brain: Allen-Bradley Micro820 PLC as the main controller
Interface: Raspberry Pi Pico with LCD display for visualization/user interface
Structure: 3D printed modular pickup truck body (bed + cab design)
Propulsion: Commercial DC gear motors with option for custom motors later
Control: Custom wireless controller using Arduino and RF communication
Special Feature: L-shaped counterweight mechanism for enhanced turning

# UNIQUE ASPECTS
Integration of industrial PLC technology in an RC vehicle
Breadboard-style truck bed showcasing the PLC installation
Split design allows for component access and modular printing
Focus on professional automation techniques rather than typical hobby approaches
Potential for documenting the ladder logic programming process

# PROJECT GOALS
Demonstrate PLC programming and integration skills
Create a functional and visually impressive remote control vehicle
Establish foundation for future enhancement with custom motors
Complete within a 2-month timeframe with approximately 20hrs/week investment
Stay within a $1000 total budget

# CURRENT STATUS
Identified key components including PLC model
Planning component integration approach
Preparing for initial ordering and design phases
Considering display integration for enhanced functionality

# OPEN QUESTIONS
What specific motors would work best for the truck's size and weight?
What is the preferred approach for the wireless control system?
How should the counterweight mechanism be designed for maximum effectiveness?
What's the best power management approach for both PLC and motors?
How will the PLC and Raspberry Pi Pico communicate most effectively?
